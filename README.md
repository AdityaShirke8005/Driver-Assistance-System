# Blind spot monitoring system for a driver assistance system

In this code, I've made the following changes:

Instead of converting the frame to grayscale, I'm using the original frame to define the ROI.
I've added an else statement to change the color of the ROI to green if no object is detected in the ROI.
I've used the numpy array slicing to change the color of the region of interest to red or green.
Also added a message to show "Warning: Object in blind spot" on the frame if object is detected in ROI
Please note that the exact values for the ROI and the edge detection threshold will likely need to be adjusted based on your specific use case and camera setup.


Note that this is a very basic example and there are many ways to improve the performance and accuracy of a blind spot monitoring system. You could use other object detection algorithm or combine it with other sensor information .

                                           # INTEGRATION SCOPE

**1) **Integrate the code into a larger driver assistance system:**** The above code can be integrated into a larger driver assistance system that includes other features such as lane detection, object detection, and collision avoidance. This can be done by adding the code to a larger script that also includes these other features, and running the script on a device such as a Raspberry Pi or an embedded system.

**2) Use the code in conjunction with other sensors:** The code can be used in conjunction with other sensors such as ultrasonic sensors, radar, or LIDAR, to detect objects in the blind spot. This can improve the accuracy and reliability of the system by cross-referencing the information from multiple sensors.

**3) Send alerts to driver:** The code can be modified to send alerts to the driver in the form of visual or audio signals, such as a warning message on the dashboard or an alarm sound, when an object is detected in the ROI.

**4) Implement the code into a vehicle's onboard computer:** The code can be integrated into a vehicle's onboard computer, such as the Engine Control Unit (ECU) or the Body Control Unit (BCU), to enable real-time monitoring of the blind spot.

**5) Use the code as a part of ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) :** The code can be used as part of a larger Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) package offered by car manufacturers. ADAS packages typically include features such as lane departure warning, automatic emergency braking, and adaptive cruise control, and the blind spot monitoring code can be added as an additional feature in these packages.

**6) Integrate with a mobile application:** The code can be integrated into a mobile application, which can be connected to the car's onboard computer via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, to allow real-time monitoring of the blind spot using a smartphone or tablet.

                                       
                                           # FUNCTIONS / PARAMETERS

1) **cv2.VideoCapture(0):** This function creates a new object to access the default camera (usually the built-in webcam on a laptop). The argument '0' specifies which camera to use; if you have multiple cameras connected, you can use integers 1, 2, etc. to select different cameras.

2) **cap.read():** This function captures a frame from the camera and returns a tuple of two values: a boolean (True if the frame was captured successfully, False otherwise) and the frame itself.

3) **cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY):** This function converts the frame from the default BGR color format to grayscale.

4) **roi = frame[200:400, 600:800]:** This line defines a region of interest (ROI) in the frame. It selects a rectangular area of the frame starting from (200,600) and ending at (400,800).

5) **cv2.Canny(roi, 100, 200):** This function applies the Canny edge detection algorithm to the ROI. The Canny edge detection algorithm is used to identify edges in an image, and it takes three arguments: the image, and two threshold values (lower and upper threshold values). The algorithm will find edges in the image that are greater than the upper threshold and less than the lower threshold.

6) **cv2.countNonZero(edges):** This function counts the number of non-zero pixels in the edges image.

7) **if edge_count > 50::** This line checks if the number of edges in the ROI is greater than 50. If it is, the code inside the if block will execute.

8) **roi[:,:] = (0, 0, 255):** This line changes the color of the entire ROI to red. It sets every pixel in the ROI to the color (0,0,255) which represents red color.

9) **cv2.putText(frame, "Warning: Object in blind spot!", (100,100), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (0,0,255), 2):** This function is used to put text on the frame. It takes several arguments: the image on which to put the text, the text to put, the position of the text on the image (x,y), the font to use, the font scale, the color of the text and the thickness of the text. In this case, the text is "Warning: Object in blind spot!" and it is placed on the position (100,100) and color is red with thickness 2.

10) **cv2.imshow("Blind Spot Monitor", frame):** This function displays the frame on the screen with the specified window name.

11) **if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):** This line waits for a key press event and check if the pressed key is 'q' or not. If the pressed key is 'q' the loop breaks.

12) **cap.release():** This function releases the camera and stops capturing frames.

13) **cv2.destroyAllWindows():** This function closes all the windows created by the OpenCV.
